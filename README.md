# Foosball-Tournament

Work in progress... Code is a bit messy at the moment (and incomplete), but I will give a detailed description of how everything works once I have it all fixed up. Currently working on implementing an all-time ranking system.

# **For Now**
Just need the Tournament.py, Play.py, and Participants.txt files. Use the Participants.txt file to add players (by line). Then run the Play.py button. You can use the -r command to choose the amount of rounds.
